#[fit]**9** steps 
#[fit]for giving 
#[fit]feedback

---

#[fit]1. 
#[fit]**Find the time.**

^Don't make the excuse that you're busy or the recipient of your feedback is busy. 
Giving feedback as soon as possible to the moment is important and makes it more likely to be effective.
Equally don't jump in while emotions are still in control, give yourself, and the subject of your feedback, time to become balanced.

---

#1. Find the time.
##Example: *"Hey, could I grab 2 minutes of your time?"*, 
##For context you could add: *"I want to give you some feedback"*.

---

#[fit]2. 
#[fit]**Be Specific.**

^While it can be easier to be general, it's much more effective to be specific about the behaviour you're giving feedback on.

---

#2. Be Specific

##Example: *"It's about the conversation we had yesterday about the paper aeroplanes I've been making."*

---

#[fit]3. 
#[fit]**Presume positive intent.**

^You may need to talk yourself through to accepting this, but always presume the other person was trying to the Right Thingâ„¢.
Now what the right thing is for them may not be the same for you, but hold on to the belief that there intent was positive. 
This also means you're feeding back on the behaviour exhibited and not the person themselves, an important distinction especially for the recipient as it makes it much easier to accept.

---

#3. Presume positive intent.

##Example: *"I understand that you want us to make the best paper aeroplanes in the world, it's great to see that you care so much about quality."*

---

#[fit]4. 
#[fit]**Be clear about the subject.**

^It's important to be clear about what the other person did/said and also about the result; how it made you feel.
You're drawing a line between the action and the consequence. Make it easy for the recipient to see how one caused the other.
Be clear and expressive but brief. Don't try to diffuse your own embarrassment by adding words and reassurances. 
Maintain eye contact if you can.

---

#4. Be clear about the subject.

##Example: *"When you commented on the way I was making my paper planes, it sounded like you assumed I don't care about quality and that made me feel unappreciated."*

---

#[fit]5. 
#[fit]**Silence is golden.**

^Don't be afraid of silence at this point. Give them the time to digest the feedback.

---

#5. Silence is golden.

##Example: *"___________________________________"*

---

#[fit]6. 
#[fit]**Throw them a lifebelt<sup>*</sup>.**

^Give an assurance again that you understand the intent.

---

#6. Throw them a lifebelt<sup>*</sup>.

##Example: *"I don't believe you intended to cause me to feel this way."*

---

#[fit]7. 
#[fit]**Offer a suggestion.**

^If they ask how they should have behaved, give them an honest and clear response.

---

#7. Offer a suggestion.

##Example: *"I would have felt much better if you'd asked me why I was focusing on making more paper aeroplanes rather than better paper aeroplanes".*

---

#[fit]8. 
#[fit]**Listen.**

^Give the recipient an opportunity to own the behaviour and apologise. Let them find there way to a better behaviour for the future.

---

#8. Listen.

##Example: *"___________________________________"*

---

#[fit]9. 
#[fit]**Don't prolong the encounter.**

^Again, don't fill empty space with words, if you're done, thank them and go back to your day.
It should feel like a small aside not a momentous issue.
The more we get in the habit of clear, timely and honest comment the more familiar we will be and the less we'll need to do it :)

---

#[fit]10. 
#[fit]**Activity.** 

^Yeah, I know you love it. Role Play!!!
I have some examples of a piece of feedback to deliver and a suggestion for how the subject could react. The goal is to get familiar with the act of giving feedback and responding to it.
In pairs, take turns delivering some feedback and receiving it.
Discuss how it made you feel on both sides and then we'll go round and listen to your experiences.
